**Note**: The following content is summarized from the YouTube video titled `Ace Product/Business Case Interview Questions: A Data-driven Approach for Data Scientists` from the `Emma Ding` channel.

# Example Interview Questions

1. What are the pros and cons of using Daily Active Users as a success metric?
2. How would you investigate a negative metric shift in time spend on the app?
3. How would you design an experiment to test a new feature?
4. How would you go about making a launch decision?

> **Note**: At least 1 round of onsite interviews focused on case questions.

# Data-Driven Approach

## What is a **Data-driven** Approach?

The idea behind a data-driven approach involves:

- Examining real interview questions to understand the distribution of interview questions and to anticipate what to expect when discussing product case questions.
- Efficiently covering common types of problems in minimal time.

## 7 Common Categories of Product Case Interview Questions

### 1. Measure Success (23%)

Example Questions:

- How would you measure the success of YouTube's Story feature?
- What metrics would you look at to see if it's doing well?

Alternate Version:

- If Uber is planning to launch a referral program for riders, what metrics would you use to measure its success?

### 2. A/B Testing (22%)

Aspects:

1. You might be given an idea and asked to design an experiment to test it.
2. You might be asked to come up with an idea first before designing an experiment to test it.

Example Questions:

- How would you set up an experiment to test a new feature in Quora?

- How would you test if the proposed change is effective or not?

**Scenario Examples:**

1. The ETA of Lyft or Uber drivers has increased by 3 minutes, and you are asked to explain why.
   - Internal factors (e.g., changes to the app's algorithm)
   - External factors (e.g., changes in traffic patterns or increased demand for rides)
2. Investigating a 1% drop in daily active users of Slack.
3. A referral program in DoorDash isn't generating the expected response rate.

### 4. Product Specific (13%)

Sample Questions:

- What should the hourly rate for Instacart shoppers be?

> These questions are designed to test the ability to **Identify obstacles**, **Analyze data**, and **Create solutions**.
