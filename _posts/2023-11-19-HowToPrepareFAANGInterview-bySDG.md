**Note**: The following content is summarized from [How I Prepared For My FAANG Interviews (As A Data Engineer)](https://youtu.be/B-3lkLniXwE) from the [Seattle Data Guy](https://www.youtube.com/@SeattleDataGuy) channel.

## Tip #1: Make sure you know what type of questions will be asked

Interview questions can vary significantly depending on the company or team you're interviewing with. In data science interviews, some companies might even ask about data structures and algorithms, which can be unexpected for many data scientists who haven't considered studying these areas. For data engineers, the range of possible questions is much wider.

For instance, in data science or engineering interviews, candidates might encounter a diverse range of questions. Some may focus on technical skills like Python, SQL, and system design, while others delve into specific areas such as data warehousing, big data, and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, interviews can also include topics like CI/CD, testing, QA, and newer technologies like Spark and Hadoop. The variety often depends on the specific role and the company's focus, emphasizing the need for broad yet targeted preparation.

This highlights the importance of asking your recruiter about the types of questions you might face. Good recruiters typically provide a list of high-level concepts to prepare for. Despite extensive preparation, it's challenging to cover every possible question. Knowing the general areas of questioning, whether it's SQL, data warehousing, big data, streaming, or in data science areas like machine learning or probability, is beneficial. Once you have an idea of the potential questions, you can prepare more effectively.

## Tip #2: Track Your Progress - Create a Guide

Develop a guide to monitor your study progress, be it a simple Google sheet or a basic Word document. This guide should assist in tracking the questions and topics you have already studied, and those yet to be tackled.

It's vital to track your progress because it's easy to lose sight of what you've already covered, or to recognize areas where you're lacking and need further study. Without this tracking, you risk neglecting crucial information, which can lead to being underprepared for interviews. You might struggle to recall specific topics that haven't crossed your mind since your school days or a previous job, particularly under the time pressure of an interview situation.

Considering the diverse range of questions posed by different companies, it's imperative to track both what you've studied and what remains. This ensures you are preparing effectively for the right interview at the right time and helps identify weak points in your knowledge that need more attention.

## Tip #3: Run Practice Interviews for Better Time Management and Insight into Company Culture

Practice interviews are an integral part of preparing for interviews with top companies like FAANG, Capital One, and Accenture. They help in understanding not only the timing of an actual interview, which typically is restricted to about an hour per section, but also provide insights into the company’s culture and principles.

#### The Role of Practice Interviews

Conducting practice interviews alone or with a partner, and using tools like a whiteboard, can help you navigate the challenges of real interview scenarios. These sessions are critical in learning how to manage your time effectively, especially when facing a variety of questions under time constraints.

#### Time Management in Interviews

Effective time management is crucial during interviews. Understanding how to allocate time, particularly when answering technical questions like SQL queries, is key. In practice sessions, you learn to gauge the time each question may require, ensuring you cover all aspects within the allotted time frame.

#### Understanding the Company’s Ethos

In addition to technical skills, understanding a company’s culture and core values like leadership and ownership is essential. Practice interviews can also focus on these areas, helping you align your responses to reflect these values, demonstrating your fit for the company.

#### Crafting Your Narrative

During preparation, revisit your resume and experiences, and develop narratives that showcase your alignment with the company’s principles. Having three to four well-prepared stories can ensure efficient use of time during the interview, enabling you to respond confidently to the interviewer’s questions.

## Tip #4: Spend some time relaxing

An important piece of advice for all interview candidates is to ensure adequate rest before the interview. Rather than trying to study or memorize additional material on the night before or the morning of the interview, it's more beneficial to take some mental rest. This approach helps reduce stress and makes it easier to recall the information you've already studied.

On the day of the interview, maintaining a calm state is crucial. Arrive at the interview location on time, but with a relaxed mindset. Instead of searching for last-minute information, it's important to think ahead about potential questions and confidently prepare your responses.

Finally, remember that an interview is a culmination of your preparation and practice. On the day of the interview, consider that you have done all the preparation you could, and approach it with a calm mind. Minimizing nervousness and maximizing focus is key to giving your best in the interview.
