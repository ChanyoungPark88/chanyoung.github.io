Question

A media company makes its money from monthly subscription fees. The company is considering entering the podcast space.

How would you measure the impact on customer lifetime value of such a move?

Step 1. Clarifiying questions & assumptions

Before I get started I want to understand a couple of different things. One I guess how what is the current monetization model and are we assuming that this is spotify and I can kind of make those assumptions for myself?

- Yes so I'd say you could probably choose spotify like the New York Times any sort of media org(organization) that you know primarily does one thing such as let's say blog posts maybe it's even music subscription with spotify's case and then is now thinking about branching into podcasting. And whether that's their own potcast or just featuring spot potcasts. So pretty open here but yeah spotify would be specifically a use case where I believe they'd be kind of entering the podcast space in terms of buying podcasts and then just featuring them on their play. Whereas the New York Times I think is a little bit more so like they're starting podcasts to then kind of sell to their existing member base and subscribers.

I see for example should we assume that like basically spotify let's I'll assume let's say that spotify is like is looking to launch a podcast specific section within their app they're thinking about how to do that and what the impact value will be.

- Yeah I think that's a good assumption.

So, do we want to make a distinction right now about is a are we targeting to introduce podcasts to free users or to premium users or do you want to go after all of them?

- Yeah yes What do you think about that because I think that's actually a pretty crutial question. And would love your take because I don't know if that's something that I would nessesarily have a decision.

Okay so I'm trying to take this as really understand first of all I want to understand why spotify or why podcasts make sense to spotify or what the kind of motivations could be behind them looking into this space and wanting to enter it. So I'm just going to break down a couple things that I know about spotify and then maybe we can fill in the gaps there and then from there we can try to understand what the internal and external motivations would be for them trying to enter this new space.

- Sounds good.

So from an internal perspective I
Step 2. Metrics to analyze the decision

Step 3. Quantify decision making

Step 4. Value/Risk Matrix

Step 5. Paying for exclusive content
