## Question

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers_, `index1` and `index2`, **_added by one_** _as an integer array_ `[index1, index2]` _of length 2_.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

<**Example 1**>

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

<**Example 2**>

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

<**Example 3**>

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

<**Constraints**>

- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

## Solution

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left, right = 0, len(numbers)-1
        increment = lambda x: x + 1
        while left < right:
            targetSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            if targetSum < target:
                left += 1
            elif targetSum > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return list(map(increment, [left, right]))
```

## Time/Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
