# Crack Metric/Business Case/Product Sense Problems for Data Scientists

## Cracking Product Sense Problems

### 1. Understanding Product Sense/Business Case/Metric Problems

- **Why and When Are These Questions Asked During Interviews?**

  - Evaluate candidates' ability to **define metrics**
  - **Diagnose and solve** real product issues
  - Assess familiarity with products (not always necessary)

- **What Are Companies Looking For?**
  - **Structure**: A systematic approach
  - **Comprehensiveness**: Addressing all crucial aspects
  - **Feasibility**: Implementable solutions
  - Occurrence: During technical phone screens and onsite interviews (>= 1 round)

### 2. Categories of Questions & Frameworks

#### 2.1 Diagnose a Problem

Given a scenario where an **important** metric has shifted **negatively**, determine the **root cause**.

- Example question1> Creation of Facebook user groups has gone down by 20%, what will you do?
- Example question2> We have a dashboard tracking our metrics, and average ETA is up by 3 minutes. How would you investigate this problem?
- Example question3> How to investigate the 10% drop of the friends application?

##### Framework for Diagnosing a Problem

1. **Clarify** the scenario/metric
2. **Assess Time**: Is the shift sudden or stable? Consider internal and external factors.
3. Examine other products/features by the same company for similar issues
4. **Segment** by user demographic and behavioral features
5. **Decompose** the metric (if necessary)
6. Summarize the overall approach, including plausible causes and remediation strategies

#### 2.2 Measure Success

Determine how to gauge the success/health of a product/feature.

- Example question1> How would you measure the success of a product?
- Example question2> How would you measure the health of Mentions, Facebook's app for celebrities?
- Example question3> Instagram is launching a new feature (link to products). How do you tell it's doing well?

##### Framework for Measuring Success

1. **Clarify** the function and goal of the product/feature
2. **Define Metrics**: Choose up to three, ensuring they are contextually relevant.

#### 2.3 Launch or Not

Decide whether to test a product idea or launch a product/feature.

- Example question1> How would you set up an experiment to understand feature change in Instagram stories?
- Example question2> What would you change in the Twitter app? How would you test if the proposed change is effective?
- Example question3> If a PM says they want to double the number of ads in Newsfeed, how would you determine if this is a good idea?

##### Framework for Deciding to Launch

1. **Clarify Goal** and define metrics similarly to the “Measure Success” framework
2. **Design Experimentation**: Detail setup, user segmentation, and duration.
3. **Make Recommendations** based on experiment results, considering business impact and possible conflicting results.

### 3. Tips to Ace the Interview

#### 3.1 Before the Interview

- **Research** the company to enable more insightful conversations

#### 3.2 During the Interview

- Always **clarify** the question, understanding the high-level goal
- **Listen** to feedback and don’t rigidly adhere to frameworks
- **Document** your thought process using bullet points
